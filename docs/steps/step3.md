# **STEP 3: Scenario selection**

A complete hazard analysis typically requires the simulation of a very large number of tsunami inundation scenarios to account for the natural variability of earthquakes and, as a consequence, their tsunamis. Since it may not be feasible to simulate hundreds of thousands or millions of scenarios, a reduction is mandatory, to select the most relevant scenarios and save computational time and resources when running the <a href=../step5 target="_blank"> tsunami simulations </a>. 

To reduce the number of scenarios retrieved from the <a href=../step2 target="_blank"> dumping </a> procedure, different strategies can be used, as alternatives to each other or in cascade:

* <a href=../../others/disaggregation> Disaggregation </a>
* <a href=../../others/sampling>Importance Sampling  </a> - (not implemented yet)
