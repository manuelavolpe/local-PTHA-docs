# **The Tsunami-HySEA code**

<a href=https://edanya.uma.es/hysea/index.php/models/tsunami-hysea target="_blank">Tsunami-HySEA</a> is the numerical model of the HySEA family, developed by the <a href=https://edanya.uma.es target="_blank">EDANYA</a> group at the University of Málaga (UMA) and in continuous evolution and upgrading. It is specifically designed for simulations of tsunamis generated by seismic events and it combines robustness, reliability and good accuracy in a model based on a GPU faster than real time (FTRT) implementation.

Tsunami-HySEA implements in the same code the three parts of an earthquake generated tsunami: generation, propagation, and coastal inundation. In the generation stage, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1785/BSSA0750041135 target="_blank">Okada</a>'s fault deformation model is used to predict the initial bottom deformation transmitted instantaneously to the sea surface, generating the tsunami wave. This method assumes that an earthquake can be considered a single-fault plane rupture. This fault is described by a series of parameters, comprising dip angle, strike angle, rake angle, fault width, fault length, and fault depth. Tsunami-HySEA can combine several fault planes to model the complete seafloor deformation. Moreover, each fault could be applied at different time steps to simulate the full rupture time.
